A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11),
and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59).

Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

Given a non-negative integer n which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on,
return all possible times the watch could represent.

Notes:
- The order of output does not matter.
- The hour must not contain a leading zero, for example "01:00" is not valid, it should be "1:00".
- The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero, for example "10:2" is not valid, it should be "10:02".

分析：电子表能够采用24小时制吗？
表示小时一共4位（bit），最大是能表示15，所以，这个电子表使用的应该是12小时制。
