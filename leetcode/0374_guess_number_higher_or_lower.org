We are playing the Guess Game.The game is as follows :

I pick a number from 1 to n.You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible
results(-1, 1, or 0) :

-1 : My number is lower
1 : My number is higher
0 : Congrats!You got it!

Example :
n = 10, I pick 6.
Return 6.

- 我有点不太明白题目的要求是什么？
- 看过答案之后，我明白了题目的要求：
  使用给定的guess函数完成给定数字的查找，传入的参数为查找的范围
